Otherwise, we use 5-byte codes for each letter (i.e. in the letter state). |

Whenever there's a repeat of a key existing in the map, increase this count by one. |

I tried to do it by importing a quicksort algorithm and trying to convert it to an arraylist and then applying it, but I think I am going down the wrong path so I'm taking a break. |
| Dec 33  |  9:15-9:51  | This session was really difficult for me, I feel like my brain has been fried after doing balloon launch full day! I tried to take another stab at my sorting algorithm for the top 256 repeats, this time using an arraylist that i fill to 256 and then inserting and removing certain elements as I go, but I gave up that approach. I am now coding the main method of the compression, finding the repeats and actually writing them. |
